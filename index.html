          <div class="big-text"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</div>
          <div class="small-text"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</div>

            learning from their experiences was easy.</div>
          <div class="small-text"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

          <div class="big-text">  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div>
          <div class="small-text"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”</div>
